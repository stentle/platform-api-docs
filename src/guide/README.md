Stentle is just born but already has a long story to tell. It is the paradox of having a team with more than 40 years of experience in e-commerce, a sector in continuous evolution towards new forms and solutions such as Omnichannel dynamics.

The barriers between physical and online store are disappearing. The store as we know it today will soon be transformed by tools that facilitate and support the shopping experience in every moment. The total union between reality and the virtual world. Stentle is in charge of this change, to redesign the store of tomorrow.
